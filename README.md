# call_counter
You can run the pre-compiled version of this by just opening the executable file located under '/dist/call_counter_gui.exe'

Source code is the main directory.

## weekly round up
Drag and drop 'weekly-roundup.py' into one of the weekly folders (i.e. Week_08) and run it in python.
This grabs all the data from every CSV file stored in that week's folder and creates a total of all the calls we got that week.
Then we can use this weekly roundup to graph pretty charts.
I may or may not turn this into a GUI.

Thanks so much! =)
